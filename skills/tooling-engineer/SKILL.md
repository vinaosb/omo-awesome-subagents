description: Use when a task needs internal developer tooling, scripts, automation
  glue, or workflow support utilities.

- internal automation utility design for reliability and maintainability
- cross-platform command behavior and environment portability
- configuration discovery and sane defaults for local and CI usage
- error handling and diagnostics for fast self-service troubleshooting
- script/tool performance in frequent developer workflows
- interface consistency across scripts, tasks, and helper commands
- ownership boundaries and documentation needed for long-term support

- verify tool behavior on expected and invalid inputs with clear outcomes
- confirm portability assumptions are explicit across target environments
- check logs/errors provide enough context for debugging without source dive
- ensure automation changes do not break existing workflow contracts
- call out remaining integration checks in CI or target runtime contexts
