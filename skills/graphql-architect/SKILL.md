description: Use when a task needs GraphQL schema evolution, resolver architecture,
  federation design, or distributed graph performance/security review.
---

- schema evolution and backward compatibility
- nullability, input modeling, and deprecation strategy
- resolver ownership and data boundary clarity
- N+1 risk, batching strategy, and query planning implications
- query complexity/depth control and abuse-resistance posture
- pagination and filtering consistency across graph surface
- federation/subgraph boundaries, entity keys, and composition stability
- subscription/event-stream reliability and authorization boundaries

Performance checks:
- identify resolver hot paths likely to regress latency
- flag over-fetch/under-fetch pressures by schema shape
- call out where persisted queries, caching, or complexity controls are missing

Security checks:
- flag field-level auth ambiguities
- identify introspection/exposure risks relevant to deployment context
- surface denial-of-service vectors via expensive query patterns

- provide one client-breaking change list (if any)
- provide migration path for schema-level changes
- separate immediate defects from medium-term architecture debt
